# 🎯 UX Improvements: Etherscan Links + Inline Event Details

## Changes Made

### 1. **🔗 Clickable Transaction Hash Links**
- **Mainnet**: Links to `https://etherscan.io/tx/{txHash}`
- **Sepolia**: Links to `https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/{txHash}`
- Added external link icon to indicate new tab opening
- Links are blue, underlined, and change color on hover

### 2. **📍 Improved Event Details UX**
- **Before**: Event details showed at the bottom of the page
- **After**: Event details appear directly below each event row
- Much better user experience - no scrolling required
- Details are contextually placed right where the user clicked

### 3. **🎨 Visual Improvements**
- External link icons on transaction hashes
- Better spacing and layout for expanded details
- Gray background for expanded rows to distinguish them
- Proper table structure maintained

## How It Works

### Transaction Hash Links
```typescript
const getEtherscanUrl = (txHash: string, network: string) => {
  const baseUrl = network === 'mainnet' 
    ? 'https://etherscan.io/tx/' 
    : 'https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/';
  return baseUrl + txHash;
};
```

### Inline Event Details
- Each event row can be expanded
- Details appear as a new table row with `colSpan={5}`
- Gray background distinguishes expanded content
- All the same information as before, but better positioned

## User Experience Flow

1. **View Events**: See events in table format
2. **Click Transaction**: Hash links directly to Etherscan
3. **Click "View Details"**: Details expand right below that event
4. **Click "Hide Details"**: Details collapse cleanly

## Benefits

✅ **No More Scrolling**: Details appear right where clicked
✅ **Direct Blockchain Access**: One-click to Etherscan
✅ **Network Aware**: Correct Etherscan URL based on network
✅ **Visual Clarity**: Icons and styling make links obvious
✅ **Better Context**: Details stay connected to their event

This makes the indexer much more user-friendly for blockchain data exploration! 🚀
